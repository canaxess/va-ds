# Testing methodology
Common elements have been identified on ~[Homepage](https://github.com/canaxess/visionaustralia-designsystem/blob/main/design-system-template/homepage.md)~ and documented. Those subsequent elements on other pages were then not repeatedly tested, that is why some tests may record no images identified when the header and footer regions contain images. These regions are applied globally and are tested once only.
- Elements pass a test when the behaviour works in a majority of combinations
- Elements fail a test when the behaviour does not work in a majority of combinations
