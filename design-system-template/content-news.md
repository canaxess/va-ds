## WCAG compliance related to 2.1 AA
- A HTML table is used on the embedded Google Maps for presentation purposes without the semantics being suppressed
- Links within the body content change colour only when in keyboard focus
- When the menu is open <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> causes the keyboard focus to leave the menu
- Table cell column **URL of Row** links use an icon and have no link text
- **On this page** side links have no keyboard focus effect
- **Download Program** is obscured by **MP3 1.04 MB)** when WCAG 2.1 AA text spacing requirements are applied

## Highly recommended usability suggestions for screen reader users

## Future proofing type suggestions
- Unecessary ALT text below Embedded Map on the decorative icon images **View Google Map** and **Share location**
- Irregular heading levels applied, `<h5>` is used for **On this page** with no preceeding lower heading level
- Use responsive web design techniques to allow **Back to news** chevron to resize when WCAG 2.1 AA text spacing requirements are applied
- Verbose title text, consider more succinct text
