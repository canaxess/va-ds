# CONTENT (GENERAL)
## WCAG compliance related to 2.1 AA
- A HTML table is used on the embedded Google Maps for presentation purposes without the semantics being suppressed
- Links within the body content change colour only when in keyboard focus
- Google Map has no iframe title text
- When the menu is open <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> causes the keyboard focus to leave the menu
- Table cell column **URL of Row** links use an icon and have no link text
- **On this page** side links have no keyboard focus effect

## Highly recommended usability suggestions for screen reader users

## Future proofing type suggestions
- Irregular heading levels applied, a `<h5>` **On this page** follows a `<h1>`
- Several false positive HTML syntax errors identified
