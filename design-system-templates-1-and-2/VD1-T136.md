## WCAG compliance related to 2.1 AA
* The **Top** link is a clickable heading element, replace with a link element
* When a [text spacing bookmarklet](https://html5accessibility.com/tests/tsbookmarklet.html) is applied page content overflows on the image **Donet Now**, and the container **Events Component With Image**
* The **Menu** and **Frequently Asked Questions** expand/collapse behaviour is not applying ARIA attributes correctly. The attribute `aria-expanded` must be applied to the link and toggled from `true` to `false`
* **Skip to main content** link does not work
## Highly recommended usability suggestions for screen reader users
* All cards have very long link text comprising of heading and body text of card, ensure the link text is only composed of the heading of each card
* The date on **Events components** cards date is announced first followed by the heading. Ensure the heading is announced first
* The date on **Events Component With Image** is announced first followed by the heading. Ensure the heading is announced first
* Whilst the **top** menu link moves focus to the top of the screen after this has occured subsequent tab positions remain at the bottom of the screen
* Heading elements are applied out of sequence
## Future proofing type suggestions
* None

## Screen reader testing
Navigation of page elements via keyboard commands was applied using JAWS v2021 and NVDA v2020.
* <kbd>Tab</kbd>, <kbd>Space</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> used to navigate interactive elements
* Links or elements list within NVDA and JAWS used to understand link text
* Navigation via headings
* Navigation via lists
### Recorded behaviour
* Within JAWS and NVDA the behaviour of the **Menu** being expanded is not audibly described
* **Frequently asked questions** expand/collpased behaviour is not audibly described
* Tabbing from **White button text** moves the screen focus to a hidden _times menu_ link (due to an 'x' in the label)
* When the menu is open the second tab position occurs outside of the expanded menu links
