## WCAG compliance related to 2.1 AA
* "Top" link is a clickable heading element
* When a text spacing bookmarklet is applied the text is overflows on the image (Donet Now), overflows it's container (Events Component With Image)
* The menu and expand/collapse is not folowing the ARIA authoring practices
### Screen reader behaviour
* Within JAWS and NVDA the beahviour of the menu being expanded is not audibly described
* Frequently asked questions expand/collpased behaviour is not audibly described
* Tabbing from "White button text" moves the screen focus to a hidden "times menu" link
* When the menu is open the second tab position is outside of the menu links
## Highly recommended usability suggestions for screen reader users
* All cards have very long link text comprising of heading and body text of card
* Events components cards date receives focus first not the important items the heading
* Events Component With Image cards receive focus on the date first not the heading which is the important item
* Whilst the "top" menu link moves focus to the top of the screen subsequent tab positions remain at the bottom of the screen
* Heading elements are applied out of sequence
* "Skip to main content" link does not work
